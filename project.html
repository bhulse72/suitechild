      1. We are building the inventory ordering functionality for Suite Child, a
      children's clothing botique.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Our project will be of great use to the owner because right now, the
      entire inventory ordering process for multiple staff members is run
      through an excel spreadsheet. Converting inventory order tracking into a
      database application will help the staff keep better track of orders going
      in and out, helping the business run more efficiently. This will also help
      remove scaling issues with the business, as an excel spreadsheet for
      tracking all orders is not sustainable for higher volumes. We will put the
      entire inventory ordering process in one place.

      3. Our data is the real inventory ordering data from Suite Child since
      2018
